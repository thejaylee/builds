Ding v0.1b
By: Jason Lee

-=About=-

This is a ping program written for NT5 based platforms. The standard windows one started to
annoy me, so I wrote my own. It uses standard winsock2 calls, and builds datagrams from
the packet (IP) level.

There's no significant argument validation, so entering stupid values will probably crash.

-=Program Usage=-

Usage: Ding [options] <host>

Options:                     
    -h precision   decimal display precision for times (default: 3)
    
    -H             disable high resolution timing
                   By default the high resolution timing call QueryPerformanceCounter() is
                   used which provides very precise timing, but may have issues on some
                   multi-cpu and/or throttled processors. Using this switch uses the
                   GetTickCount() call, which is stable, but only has a resolution of ~15ms.
                   
    -t ttl         Time To Live (default: 64)
                   IP time to live to set for datagrams.

    -S sqnc        initial 16bit ICMP sequence number  (default: 0)

    -i id          16bit identification to use for ICMP  (default: 57005)
                   
    -w timeout     time in ms to wait for replies  (default: 750ms)
                   
    -f delay       antiflood time in ms between queries  (default: 250ms)
                   Time to wait between queries to prevent packet flooding.
    
    -n count       number of queires to send  (default: 5)
                   A value of 0 will ping continuosly.
                   The number of queries to send.
                   
    -s size        payload size in bytes  (default: 32)
                   The payload size to send in the tracers. For those who really want to know
                   the payload is just filled with lower case repeating alphabet.

    -q             run in quiet mode
                   Only prints the statistics line. Useful to have a condensed display when
                   sending many pings.

    -d             run in diagnostic mode (ignores -s)
                   Diagnostic mode pings a host with 4, 16, 64, 256 then 1024 byte payloads.
                   It is recommened to use this in conjuction with quiet mode, especially when
                   sending many packets.
                     
                     

preset switches:
The preset switches are synonyms for already existing switches with parameters.
preset switches may also be used together (ie. --stat --faster)
    --fast       -f 100 -w 350
    --faster     -f 50 -w 250
    --fastest    -f 0 -w 150
    --stat       -d -q -n 25
    --mon        -f 1000 -q -n 0
    
-=Usage Notes=-

switches are parsed in the order they are read, so overloading may be done.
For example: specifying "--faster --stat -n 10" will use 10 pings of the 25 set with --stat.

-=Known Issues=-

There are some issues with usage on computers with multiple NICs, or, VPN(s). Sometimes it will
try to use the incorrect interface for the route and return desination unreachable.
