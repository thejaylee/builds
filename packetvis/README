PacketVis
Jason Lee 2010

DESCRIPTION
===========
PacketVis is a simple 3D real-time network packet visualizer, not much more to
say :) It can show some basic network and program statistics, but nothing very
verbose just yet.

PacketVis represents all data in a 3D cubic space. Network enpoints and packets
are represented by a grey cross and 3D balls respectively. The endpoint's XYZ
coordinates are determined by IP and Port as follows:
X - IP high order 16 bits
Z - IP low order 16 bits
Y - logarithm of port (midpoint for ICMP)

The size and gravity of a ball is proportional to the byte size of the
corresponding packet. Colors of the balls are as follows:
Blue  - TCP
Green - UDP
Red   - ICMP


INSTALLATION
============
No installation is neccessary for PacketVis, but there are dependancies.

PacketVis uses WinPCap and SDL. It has been compiled against WinPCap v4.1.2 and
SDL v1.2. SDL.DLL is included and should be all that is required for SDL.

USAGE
=====
PacketVis requires three commandline arguments to run

PacketVis.exe <devnum> <width> <height>
Where:
devnum  is the device number (acquired with listdevs.exe)
width   is the x resolution for rendering
height  is the y resolution for rendering

Mouse and key bindings are provided for interactivity and toggling of options.

Mouse:
left click + drag - change orientation
wheel - zoom in/out

Keys:
R - toggle autorotate
S - toggle statistics
P - toggle projection of crosses onto the walls of the cube
L - toggle dashed lines between endpoints and wall crosses
